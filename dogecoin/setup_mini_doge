Step-by-Step Instructions for Setting Up a Mini Doge Miner

1. Unbox & Inspect Your Miner

Carefully remove the Mini Doge miner, its power supply unit (PSU), Ethernet cable, and user manual.

Check all components for visible damage.


2. Connect the Hardware

Plug the PSU securely into the miner.

Attach one end of the Ethernet cable to the miner and the other to your router or switch.


3. Power On

Plug the PSU into a wall outlet.

Allow a few minutes for the miner to boot and initialize.


4. Access the Miner’s Interface

Use your router’s interface to locate the miner’s assigned IP address (listed under connected devices).

Enter that IP in your web browser to open the miner's configuration panel.


5. Configure Your Mining Pool

Login using the default credentials provided in your user manual.

Go to the Miner Configuration section and input:

Your preferred stratum pool URL.Your worker name

(Optional) A password if required

Save the changes.


6. Monitor Miner Performance

Navigate to the Miner Status or similar tab to view real-time stats like hash rates and device health.

You can also monitor from the pool dashboard if supported.

Look for stable operation and correct hashing rates.


7. Use a Dogecoin Wallet & Join a Pool

Create a Dogecoin wallet via official Dogecoin Core, Exodus, or a hardware wallet like Ledger.

Choose a reliable mining pool (e.g., F2Pool, ViaBTC, LitecoinPool) that supports merged mining (LTC + DOGE).

Input your wallet address in the pool’s payout settings.


8. Environmental Tips & Profitability

Electricity: ASIC miners use significant power—Goldshell Mini-Doge PRO draws around 220 W 

Cooling: Maintain good ventilation or ambient cooling; ASICs generate considerable heat 

Profit Considerations: Profitability depends heavily on your electricity cost (ideally under ~$0.08 USD/kWh) and miner efficiency
